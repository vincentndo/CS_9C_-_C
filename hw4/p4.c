/*
 *  Play the "animal" game, in which the program attempts to guess an animal
 *  that the user is thinking of by asking yes or no questions. Eventually,
 *  the program either will guess the user's animal or run out of questions
 *  to ask. In the latter case, the program will ask the user to provide a
 *  yes-or-no question that would distinguish between the user's animal and
 *  the program's best guess.
 *  The data structure of questions and guesses is essentially a binary tree,
 *  with each internal node having a "yes" branch and a "no" branch. Leaves
 *  of the tree represent animals to be guessed by the program. If the program
 *  fails to guess the user's animal, it replaces one of the leaves of the tree
 *  by a node containing the new question, whose children are the program's
 *  best guess and the animal provided by the user.
 *  The structure of the program is simple. It initializes the question/guess
 *  data structure, then plays games as long as the user is interested. In each
 *  game, the program starts at the top of the tree (the root) and progresses
 *  toward the bottom (the leaves) depending on the user's responses. Once it
 *  reaches a leaf, it either has won or lost, and handles the situation as
 *  described above.
