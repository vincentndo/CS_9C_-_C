1. Add ; to the end of line 53
add void to convert

2. The output shows repeated results --> something is wrong.

3. ASCII of '4' - ASCII of '0' copied to maxNumConsonant. use print maxNumConsonant to find outh maxNumConsonant = 4.

4. 0x7fffffffde90 is stored in phone, which is the address/pointer to the string "4460175"

5. for loop works, the evidence is the array phone_int is assigned {4, 4, 6, 0, 1, 7, 5} by using tricks {'4' - '0', ...}

6. the loops work from inside to outside. We know it by throwing a bunch of display to see the change of indices

7. word=0x7fffffffde50 "ggm01pj", use print word. The value is correct
8. passing pointer allows the program access and change the value it points to.

9. We expect the address of level does not change but the value it points to increases by 1 --> change *level++ into (*level)++
